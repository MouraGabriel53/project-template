# Development

## Stack

<!-- Language, build tool, main libraries. -->

## Commands

```bash
# build
# unit tests
# all tests
# run locally
```

## Continuous integration

<!-- One row per workflow job. -->

| Workflow | What it does |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/conventions.yml` | fails if the pull request title or any of its commits does not follow Conventional Commits |

Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) opens weekly pull requests for dependency updates.

## Commit and pull request conventions

Commit messages and pull request titles follow
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `build` (build
system and dependencies) and `ci` (CI workflows). Add `!` before `:` for a
breaking change.

Run once after cloning to check messages locally and get the message template
in the editor:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks       # rejects commits outside the convention
git config commit.template .gitmessage    # opens the template on `git commit`
```

New pull requests are filled with `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

## Documentation

- Change [architecture.md](architecture.md) and [contracts.md](contracts.md)
  in the same pull request as the code they describe.
- Plan large changes as a spec in [specs/](specs/README.md) before coding.
- Record non-obvious choices in [decisions/](decisions/README.md).
